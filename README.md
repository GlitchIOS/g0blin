# g0blin

An incomplete jailbreak for A7-A9 devices on iOS 10.3.x

Spawns an SSH server listening on port 2222. Remember to change your passwords!

Please reinstall the bootstrap when upgrading.


## What is still broken?

Third-party applications that need root priveledges require an extra entitlement to function correctly.

````
<key>com.apple.private.security.no-container</key>
<true/>
````

I have already added the entitlement to the copy of Cydia included in g0blin.

For other apps (eg. Filza, MTerminal) to work correctly you will have to entitle them yourself.
